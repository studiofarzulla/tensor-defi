\subsection{Alignment Testing}

To quantify the relationship between whitepaper narratives and market behavior,
we compute Tucker's congruence coefficient ($\phi$) between three representation
spaces: (i) claim profiles derived from NLP classification, (ii) summary
statistics computed from OHLCV data, and (iii) latent factor loadings extracted
via CP tensor decomposition.

Tucker's $\phi$ measures the cosine similarity between paired factor loadings
after Procrustes rotation \citep{tucker1951method, lorenzo2006tucker}:
\begin{equation}
\phi = \frac{\sum_i x_i y_i}{\sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2 \sum_i y_i^2}}
\end{equation}
where $x$ and $y$ are corresponding factor loading vectors. Following
\citet{lorenzo2006tucker}, we interpret $|\phi| \geq 0.95$ as factor equivalence,
$|\phi| \geq 0.85$ as fair similarity, $|\phi| \geq 0.65$ as moderate similarity,
and lower values as weak or negligible correspondence.

To accommodate dimension mismatch between representations (8 claim categories,
7 summary statistics, 2 latent factors), we apply orthogonal Procrustes rotation
with zero-padding to the smaller matrix. Statistical significance is assessed
via permutation testing (2,000 permutations), and 95\% confidence intervals are
computed via bootstrapping (2,000 resamples).

\subsection{Alignment Results}

Table~\ref{tab:alignment-results} presents congruence coefficients for all
pairwise comparisons across the 23 entities with both
whitepaper claims and market data.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Tucker's Congruence Coefficient ($\phi$) Between Representation Spaces}
\label{tab:alignment-results}
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
Comparison & $\phi$ & 95\% CI & $p$-value \\
\midrule
Claims $\leftrightarrow$ Statistics & 0.341 & [0.34, 0.55] & 0.332 \\
Claims $\leftrightarrow$ Factors & 0.077 & [0.07, 0.16] & 0.747 \\
Statistics $\leftrightarrow$ Factors & 0.197 & [0.16, 0.24] & $<$0.001*** \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\footnotesize

\textit{Note:} $n=23$ entities. Significance: *** $p < 0.001$.
All $\phi$ values fall below the 0.65 threshold for moderate similarity.
\end{table}

The key finding is the absence of significant alignment between whitepaper
claims and either market statistics ($\phi = 0.341$, $p = 0.33$)
or latent market factors ($\phi = 0.077$, $p = 0.75$).
In contrast, the statistics--factors comparison achieves statistical significance
($p < 0.001$) despite weak magnitude ($\phi = 0.197$), reflecting the
expected correspondence between summary measures and decomposed factors that
both derive from market price data.

The statistical significance without substantive magnitude in the
statistics--factors comparison illustrates why $\phi$ magnitude matters beyond
$p$-values: both representations capture market dynamics, so non-zero coupling
is expected, but the coupling is too weak ($\phi \ll 0.65$) to support
meaningful inference. For claims, even this weak coupling is absent---whitepaper
narratives occupy a representational space that is orthogonal to revealed market
dynamics.


% === ROBUSTNESS: BTC EXCLUDED ===

\paragraph{Robustness: Bitcoin Excluded.}
Bitcoin's dominant market position could drive the tensor factor structure.
Excluding BTC ($n=22$) yields $\phi = 0.081$ for claims--factors
(vs.\ $\phi = 0.077$ with full sample), confirming that the null
alignment is not an artifact of Bitcoin's outlier behavior. The statistics--factors
alignment weakens modestly ($\phi = 0.173$ vs.\ $0.197$) but
remains significant ($p = 0.008$), suggesting Bitcoin contributes to but does
not solely determine the latent factor structure.
